## 4.1 Some Conversations

1. What do you enjoy most about your job/studies?
> I really like my job, especially since I work as a database internal engineer. My primary responsibility is making our product perform better and tackling tricky issues. Whenever I'm trying to boost performance, I brainstorm ideas and chat with my colleagues about them. They are super smart and competent and always gives me fresh perspectives and insights that really open my eyes. And another part is Problem-solving. It feels like being a detective – you know, figuring out which clues matter and which don't to get to the bottom of things.

1. Describe a memorable trip you have taken. Including  Where did you go? Why was it memorable? What did you do there?
> Honestly, I'm usually the kind of person who likes to chill at home. But there was one trip with my wife to Okinawa in Japan that I can't forget. We were there for a few days. We visited the sea museum there, It's apparently the biggest in Asia. We saw all sorts of cool sea creatures – dolphins, sharks, whales – and some of them even put on a show! The water there was unreal, so clear and blue, nothing like back home. Oh, and the food? We had some amazing steak and seafood. Tasted great, but it was a little bit expensive. And we also did some shopping. My wife had this friend in China who wanted some makeup from Japan, so we hit up a few pharmacy stores.
