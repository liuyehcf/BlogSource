## 4.1 Some Conversations

1. What do you enjoy most about your job/studies?
> I really like my job, especially since I work as a database internal engineer. My primary responsibility is making our product perform better and tackling tricky issues. Whenever I'm trying to boost performance, I brainstorm ideas and chat with my colleagues about them. They are super smart and competent and always gives me fresh perspectives and insights that really open my eyes. And another part is Problem-solving. It feels like being a detective – you know, figuring out which clues matter and which don't to get to the bottom of things.

1. Describe a memorable trip you have taken. Including  Where did you go? Why was it memorable? What did you do there?
> Honestly, I'm usually the kind of person who likes to chill at home. But there was one trip with my wife to Okinawa in Japan that I can't forget. We were there for a few days. We visited the sea museum there, It's apparently the biggest in Asia. We saw all sorts of cool sea creatures – dolphins, sharks, whales – and some of them even put on a show! And for me, the best part was the sea water, it was unreal, so clear and blue, nothing like back home. Oh, and the food? We had some amazing steak and seafood. Tasted great, but it was a little bit expensive. And we also did some shopping. My wife had this friend in China who wanted some makeup from Japan, so we hit up a few pharmacy stores.

1. Can you describe the place where you live? What do you like or dislike about it?
> I live in Hangzhou, which is known for its stunning natural beauty and historical significance. One of the things I love most about living here is the breathtaking West Lake. It's a perfect spot for relaxation and offers a serene escape from the bustling city life. The lake is surrounded by lush greenery and traditional pagodas, which makes it a picturesque place for walks or boat rides.
> In addition to the natural scenery, Hangzhou is rich in culture and history. There are numerous temples and ancient buildings that provide a glimpse into China's past. As someone interested in history, I find this aspect of the city particularly fascinating.
> However, one downside is that Hangzhou can be quite crowded, especially during tourist seasons. The influx of visitors can make the city feel overwhelming at times, and traffic congestion can be a significant issue. Despite this, I think the city's charm and beauty outweigh these minor inconveniences

1. How do you usually spend your weekends?
> Over the weekends, I mostly enjoy unwinding at home. My time is often divided between cooking and digital entertainment. I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, which is both relaxing and rewarding. Additionally, I spend a fair amount of time playing smartphone games and watching live streams. These activities are not only enjoyable but also help me stay connected and engaged with my interests.

1. Introduce a member of your family.
> I'd like to tell you about my father. He was born into a humble family as the youngest of five siblings, with four older sisters. Despite their financial struggles, his family was very loving and supportive, which gave him a happy childhood. He was a dedicated student and worked extremely hard to achieve his goals. Remarkably, he earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, which was quite an achievement given his background. After graduating, he worked as a workshop manager for a state-owned company. It was a challenging time as corruption was widespread, but my father always maintained his integrity and never got involved in any corrupt practices, something that I deeply admire about him. Later on, the state-owned company went bankrupt, and he ventured into entrepreneurship and started a small business in metal chemical processing with around ten employees. His journey from a modest upbringing to becoming a successful business owner is truly inspiring. And he is always the one that I look up to.
