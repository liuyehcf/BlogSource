# 1 Self Introduction

Nice to meet you! Thank you for taking the time to interview me. My name is Calvin, and I am from China. I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees from BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), where I specialized in communication engineering. During my postgraduate studies, I began self-learning computer science to further broaden my skills.

Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of working for two distinguished companies. The first company is Alibaba Group. During my time there, I was part of the IoT department, where our team focused on developing a platform for managing and facilitating various devices, such as smart home security systems and industrial sensors. Additionally, we aimed to facilitate industrial upgrading for diverse industries.

Following my experience at Alibaba Group, I joined a startup, which is widely recognized for its exceptional OALP (Open Analytics and Log Processing) database product in China, called StarRocks. This product stands out for its outstanding performance.

Once again, I'm delighted to meet you, and I am eager to discuss more during this interview.

# 2 Experience Questions

## 2.1 Tunnel Service

### 2.1.1 Introduction

The tunnel service is specifically designed to meet the demand for accessing private network devices through SSH and HTTP protocols. At our platform, we have seamlessly integrated these capabilities into our platform console, available at aliyun.com.

Tunnel service refers to an overlay network that operates above the TCP protocol, employing an asymmetric architecture. This design comprises three principal components: the tunnel server, user-side agent, and device-side agent. The tunnel server acts as a central hub, providing authentication and facilitating the communication between the user-side agent and the device-side agent. The device-side agent connects to the server and routes messages between the actual local service such as sshd and the server. On the other hand, the user-side agent connects to the server and handles message routing between the user and the server. 

In terms of usability, we have simplified the usage of the HTTP and SSH protocols. For SSH protocol, the user-side agent can be a terminal component embedded in our platform, providing the necessary functionality. And for HTTP protocol, any standard web browser can act as the agent, which is truly magical in terms of versatility and convenience. And for other protocol that based on tcp, user must run additional agent at his computer to listen and forward traffic.

For ease of implementation, we have adopted WebSocket as the underlying protocol on both the user-side and device-side. This choice allows for seamless communication and simplifies the integration process.

### 2.1.2 Details of the ssh proxy

The platform provides a convenient web terminal component for SSH/SFTP protocol, ensuring ease of use. This component transfers plain text to the server, which then wraps it using the SSH protocol and directs it to the device's 22 port within a private network.

### 2.1.3 Details of the http proxy

This approach relies on a premise that the majority of standard browsers include the original domain name in the HTTP header as `Host`. Whenever the user enables this feature, a temporary domain name is generated, consisting of an UUID as the first segment, which maps to a specific device information. As a result, the server can extract tunnel information from the Host property and precisely direct traffic to the corresponding destinations.

## 2.2 Flow Execution Framework

The second thing I've done is provide two important frameworks to facilitate the device rule center, which is built to offer efficient management of device linkage rules, such as automatically turning on the lights after the door is opened, and facilitating the generation of device warnings as well as message routing.

The first framework is the flow execution framework, an integral part of the device rule center, providing two critical functions. Firstly, it incorporates a flow DSL implemented using my own compiler project, which provides various statements, including 'if-else', 'join-then', 'select-then', 'sub-then', and supports both cascaded and parallelized link types. These statements represent different node types such as actions, conditions, gateways, subflows as well as various types of listeners. Secondly, it features an event-driven execution engine, where each task executes its designated functions and generates subsequent tasks to progress the flow. Additionally, it includes features such as exception short-circuiting and execution profiling.

The second framework is the expression execution framework, a component of the flow execution framework that simplifies expression evaluation. It is built using my own compiler project, and supports various literals, operators, operator overloading, built-in functions, and user-defined functions, including both fixed and variable parameters.

## 2.3 Edge Gateway Device

The third project I participated in was an intelligent edge integrated machine, designed to support industrial applications and device connections. Its use cases span various scenarios, including facial recognition access control systems, parking fee collection systems, automated vlogging systems, and more. My primary responsibility is to build a pipeline for creating various customized operating system installation images(can be an iso file or just a rootfs). This image includes the original CentOS or Ubuntu system packages as well as all the necessary software and configurations required by our business. Additionally, I have designed and developed a troubleshooting tool, primarily focused on addressing network and Kubernetes (k8s) runtime environment issues.

## 2.4 Questions

**Tunnel Service:**

1. How does the tunnel service work?
    * It begins with the user opening the terminal on our console or navigating to another web page with a unique address. Then, the server sends a 'NewSession' packet to the corresponding device. If the specific port of the local device is available, the session is established. Any actions from the user will be routed to the device, and any messages from the device's service will be routed to the user.
1. How can the web browser serve as the user-side agent without any configuration?
    * The web browser will set the original host as the 'Host' field in the HTTP header. By leveraging this property, the server can create a unique HTTP address for a specific service of a particular user. The first segment of the address is a UUID, which can be resolved to its corresponding tunnel information. This helps the server direct the traffic to the correct edge device.

**Device Rule Center:**

1. How many types of device warnings are there?
    * Device online/offline, Battery dead, Cpu/Memory/Disk pressure
1. What's the function of message route?
    * The function of a message route is to deliver specific messages that are required by a single service from quantities of original device messages.
1. Why not just use the message middleware?
    * Offers more flexibility in routing messages than message middleware platforms like Kafka or RocketMQ, allowing for the provision of more complex rules based on the structural characteristics of the device messages.

**Compile-engine:**

    * QLExpress, Alibaba

**OS Image Pipeline:**

1. What's the function of the OS pipeline?
    * The pipeline supports the selection of various customized configurations, such as different applications, network settings, partition setups, and account configurations.
    * CentOS offers an image build tool called Anaconda, which provides a flexible configuration known as kickstart for customized settings. This includes network configuration, disk setup, account settings, as well as scripts for more complex configurations.
    * Different production methods, including PXE(Preboot Execution Environment), Master Disk Duplication, Root Filesystem Flashing

## 2.5 Starrocks

I have been employed at Starrocks for the past two years. I was luckily involved in the fundamental re-design and re-implementation of the execution engine right after I joined the company. This refactor involves transitioning from a volcano execution model to a more efficient and flexible morsel-driven execution engine, where I was responsible for implementing several operators like aggregator, window function and table function.

My contributions at Starrocks have spanned both the execution engine and plan optimization, resulting in significant improvements to the system's performance and observability.

In terms of plan optimization, I enhanced the system's capabilities by incorporating various types of subqueries like join on subquery and scalar non-agg subquery, and efficiently refactored the subquery transformation process to achieve the optimization of constant removal. Additionally, I refactored a plan enumeration mechanism that allows for thorough testing of the efficiency of cost-based algorithm, ensuring optimal query execution plans.

As for execution, my focus was on optimizing the ranking window function, leading to an impressive 10x performance improvement. And I have designed and implemented a parallel merge operator(based on Merge Path algorithm) that delivered a remarkable 10x performance boost, effectively overcoming the bottlenecks associated with serial merge. Additionally, I have achieved many things, including introducing a sliding window technique to parallelize ordered data transformation, and addressing numerous performance issues such as reducing code cache misses and eliminating pointer aliases for SIMD optimizations.

For better observability and query analysis, I introduced support for runtime profiling and developed a profile analysis tool. This feature enables users to easily understand query bottlenecks and identify opportunities for optimization.

1. Explain the design of the scheduler of morsel-driven execution engine.
    1. The minimum execution unit, which is called a pipeline driver, is basically an execution link comprising a sequence of operators.
    1. The smallest processing unit is referred to as a morsel or a chunk of data. Its size should be large enough to help amortize scheduling overhead and should fit into the cache for better performance.
    1. The ready driver will be put in the multilevel feedback queue, waiting to be scheduled.
    1. And all the blocking drivers will be put into a global queue, and there is a separate thread to perform the task readiness analysis for better responsiveness.
1. What are the core values of StarRocks?
    1. Fast
    1. Unified, contains almost all the capabilities, like MV, lakehouse, cloud native, stream/batch processing
1. What are the advantages of the MPP architecture?
    1. High Performance
    1. Better Resource Utilization
    1. Better Scalability and Flexibility
1. Why do you refactor the subquery transformation process?
    * In the previous process, the subquery would be transformed to ApplyOperator first, missing the opportunity to apply optimizations such as constant removal or predicate simplification.
    * After this refactor, the subquery used as an expression will be temporarily held back until the expression optimizations are performed, allowing it to fully benefit from these optimizations.
1. What's optimization can lead to 10 times performance boost of the ranking window function?
    * When using a ranking window function with a predicate or a limit clause, we have the option to include an additional partition-topn node to filter the data. This can lead to significant improvements, particularly when it comes to filtering out large amounts of data.
1. What are the advantages of the morsel-driven execution engine?
    * It is easier to support fine-grained isolation, like resource group.
    * Reduce the scheduling overhead and optimize the utilization of available CPU resources.
    * It is easier to set different parallelism for different parts of the query.
1. Could describe the subquery classifications?
    * [Summary-of-Key-Points](/_posts/Summary-of-Key-Points.md)
1. How many subquery transformation rules in Starrocks?
    * [DBMS-Optimizer](/_posts/DBMS-Optimizer.md)
1. How does starrocks process subquery?
    * Subqueries are always placed within expressions. After constant removal and predicate simplification are performed, a subquery can be replaced with an apply operator and attached to the logical tree. Finally, different types of joins can be utilized to transform the apply operator.
1. What is the process of window function?
    * The process varies based on the window classification. For unlimited window, the whole process will be performed in blocking mode, and for half-unlimited window, the process will be performed in streaming mode. And for sliding window, things are simpler.
    * Blocking mode means you must wait until all the data for the current partition has arrived.
    * Streaming mode means that you can process the current data as more data from this partition is coming.
1. What is hive meta store?
1. What is the function of cache metadata?
1. What are the competitors of Starrocks?
    * Top-tier: Snowflake, Databricks
    * Second-tier: AWS Redshift/Athena, Google Cloud Bigquery, Azure Synapse
    * Third-tier: Starburst, Dremio, Singlestore, Clickhouse, Imply, Startree, Ahana
    * Trino, lake house
    * Druid, wide table
    * Presto, execution
1. Explain the details of the parallel merge operator.
    * The implementation is based on the MergePath algorithm, the most impressive part of this algorithm is that each core can independently compute the data segment required by current core. Multiple inputs are organized into a Merge tree. The entire merge process uses the stream model and requires multiple traversals of the merge tree. Each traversal uses a bottom-up approach, with all cores sequentially processing each node, for example, all cores are working on a merge node's process and then goes to the next merge node. And additionally, I dopted late materialization to further improve the performance.
1. Why do you introduce morsel-driven execution model?
    * Because comparing to the volcano execution model, morsel-driven execution model has better fexibility on resource control, priority control and parallelism control. And we also expect it can have better scheduling efficiency.
1. What's the design of the morsel-driven execution model?
    * Morsel
        * Morsel is a  small chunk or portion of data, in our system, its value is 4096.
    * Pipeline and Pipeline Driver
        * Pipeline is a logical concept that represents an execution link, comprising of a sequence of operators that without blocking operations.
        * Each compute node will receive an execution tree, the tree will be decomposed to multiply pipelines, and all the materialized nodes will be split into two pipelines. For example, the join node will split into two pipelines, one contains join_build, and another contains join_probe. And each pipeline can have several parallelism, called pipeline driver, which is the minimum scheduling unit.
    * User-Space Scheduler
        * The size of work threads is equal to the size of cpu cores. And core-binding can have better cache locality.
        * And for scheduling algorithm, generally, there are two different options, one is Global Balance, which contains a local queue and a block queue, providing the precise wake-ups; and another choice is Work-Stealing, comprising of a multi-level feedback queue, and may have false wake-ups. The pipeline driver with longer overall execution time may have lower priority and may stay in the higher level.
        * And another thing is task readiness analysis for checking if a task is ready or blocked, there are also two choices, polling model and event-driven model, but the state change of the task in database system is more complex comparing to the threads scheduling in kernel which can only come from limited cases like cpu time slice exhausted, hardware interrupt, system call, mutex and explicit yielding, the state change in database system may come from asynchronous operations, task dependency readiness, and more complex condition that may contains several variables and compoments. So polling model is suitable for database system, and simplify the process to a great extend. And in our system, there will be a seperate thread to do the task readiness analysis.
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Volcano Execution Model and Morsel-driven execution model?
    * Volcano execution model is simple for programming. And the minimum scheduling unit is thread, so scheduling decision is delegated to kernel. But it is hard to have fine-grained resource control, priority control and parallelism control.
    * For morsel-driven execution model, the programming model is more complex, each operator has to handle state change like if it has output or if it need input, and need to provide two interfaces push_chunk and pull_chunk, and blocking opeartions are not allowed, and for some operators like scan and exchange, extra I/O thread pool is required to handle the I/O operations. But it can have more flexible resource control, priority control, and parallelism control, you can set different parallelism for different parts of a single query.
1. What the process of executing a query?
    * Generally, it has two stages, plan and execution. Firstly, it will go through rule-based optimizations and cost-based optimizations to generate an optimal physical plan, the plan will contains several segments, connected by exchagne operator. And in practical system, there will be multiply compute nodes, so each fragment will have multiply parallelism to fully use the machine resource, and each parallelism is called fragment instance. When a compute node received a fragment instance, basically, the fragment instance is an execution tree, it will be decomposed into multiply pipelines, and each pipeline will have multiply parallelism to fully use the multi-cores resources.
1. What's the process of aggregation operator?
    * Generally speaking, for aggregation without group by, there will be a two-stage process, the first stage is called pre-aggregate, where each node perform the aggregation and calculate the intermediate result locally, and then send to one intended node for final aggregation. And for aggregation with group by, there will be a one-stage process, each node will shuffle the scanned data by the group by expression, and then multi-machine and multi-core parallel aggregation processing is carried out.
1. What's the process of window operator?
    * For window function without partition by, the data will be sorted globally and send to one node to further continue the serial window process. And for window function with partition by, the data will be shuffled and sorted locally, and then multi-machine and multi-core parallel window processing is carried out.
    * And for window function that is not relied on the ordering, like min/max, we have hash-based partition to further improve the performance.
1. What's the process of join operator?
    * Generally speaking, a join involves a two-stage processing method. The first stage is called "build," where a hash_table is generated based on a smaller table. The second stage, known as "probe," involves going through the hash_table to evaluate matches based on specific predicates.
    * Local and Global runtime filters will be generated at build stage to further improve the performance.
1. How resource group is achieved?
    * This feature is part of the scheduler. Each resource group has independent queue management. Every query is related to a specific resource group and will be managed by the multi-level feedback queue within that group.
    * How to precisely control the resource utilization?
1. What's the problem of cache miss rates? How do you address it?
    * I found that a refactoring PR caused this decrease in performance. After this PR, there's a large template function with many branches, but the query with the performance degradation only goes through one of the branches. I suspect that when the instructions are loaded into the code cache, instructions from unused branches are partly loaded, leading to frequent replacements in the code cache line. This might be what's causing the performance degradation. However, we tested this only on virtual machines in Alibaba Cloud. Some lower-level perf-events, such as branch-miss and cache-miss, are not supported on VMs, so we couldn't directly verify this hypothesis. To address the issue, we separated different branches into distinct template functions and marked them as "always not inlined."
