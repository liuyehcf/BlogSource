1. Introduction to the Work Mode; We\'re a big team of around 50 database developers, split into maybe 5 groups, each focusing on areas like storage, query execution, cloud native, lake house, and SaaS. I\'m part of the query group.\n\nIn our group, here\'s how we roll: We usually iterate on a two-month cycle, and in each cycle, we will have one or two targets, like rolling out a new feature or improving performance or stability. And each member will get their own pieces. And if the topic is big enough, we will do some research and produce a research document for discussion, so we can all chat about it.\n\nAfter we\'ve tossed around some ideas, we get down to writing a design document. It\'s like our game plan, detailing how we\'re getting things done, and everyone gets to review it.\n\nFinally, we get to the fun part – coding. And of course, we make sure to review each other\'s code. It keeps things running smoothly and makes sure we\'re all on the same page.
1. Introduce a member of your family; I\'d like to tell you about my father. He was born into a humble family as the youngest of five siblings, with four older sisters. Despite their financial struggles, his family was very loving and supportive, which gave him a happy childhood. He was a dedicated student and worked extremely hard to achieve his goals. Remarkably, he earned a bachelor\'s degree in chemical engineering, which was quite an achievement given his background. After graduating, he worked as a workshop manager for a state-owned company. It was a challenging time as corruption was widespread, but my father always maintained his integrity and never got involved in any corrupt practices, something that I deeply admire about him. Later on, the state-owned company went bankrupt, and he ventured into entrepreneurship and started a small business in metal chemical processing with around ten employees. In summary, his journey from a modest upbringing to becoming a successful business owner is truly inspiring. And he is always the one that I look up to.

1. levy; tax; excise; Levy: This is a general term that refers to the legal process of imposing or collecting a tax, fee, or fine. A levy can be applied to a wide range of financial obligations, such as taxes, fees for services, or fines for legal violations. It\'s more about the action of imposing or collecting these charges.\n\nTax: A tax is a mandatory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or a legal entity) by a governmental organization. Taxes are used to fund various public expenditures. Taxes can come in many forms, such as income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc. The term \"tax\" is more about the financial charge itself, rather than the act of imposing or collecting it.\n\nExcise: An excise is a specific type of tax that is levied on particular goods, services, or activities. This is often a form of indirect tax, meaning it is collected by an intermediary (like a store) from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax (such as the consumer). Excise taxes are commonly placed on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and fuel.\n\n

1. How do you usually spend your weekends?; Over the weekends, I mostly enjoy unwinding at home. My time is often divided between cooking and digital entertainment. I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, which is both relaxing and rewarding. Additionally, I spend a fair amount of time playing smartphone games and watching live streams. These activities are not only enjoyable but also help me stay connected and engaged with my interests.
1. Can you describe the place where you live? What do you like or dislike about it?; I live in Hangzhou, which is known for its stunning natural beauty and historical significance. One of the things I love most about living here is the breathtaking West Lake. It\'s a perfect spot for relaxation and offers a serene escape from the bustling city life. The lake is surrounded by lush greenery and traditional pagodas, which makes it a picturesque place for walks or boat rides.\n\nIn addition to the natural scenery, Hangzhou is rich in culture and history. There are numerous temples and ancient buildings that provide a glimpse into China\'s past. As someone interested in history, I find this aspect of the city particularly fascinating.\n\nHowever, one downside is that Hangzhou can be quite crowded, especially during tourist seasons. The influx of visitors can make the city feel overwhelming at times, and traffic congestion can be a significant issue. Despite this, I think the city\'s charm and beauty outweigh these minor inconveniences.
1. Describe a memorable trip you have taken. Including  Where did you go? Why was it memorable? What did you do there?; Honestly, I\'m usually the kind of person who likes to chill at home. But there was one trip with my wife to Okinawa in Japan that I can\'t forget. We were there for a few days. We visited the sea museum there, It\'s apparently the biggest in Asia. We saw all sorts of cool sea creatures – dolphins, sharks, whales – and some of them even put on a show! And for me, the best part was the sea water, it was unreal, so clear and blue, nothing like back home. Oh, and the food? We had some amazing steak and seafood. Tasted great, but it was a little bit expensive. And we also did some shopping. My wife had this friend in China who wanted some makeup from Japan, so we hit up a few pharmacy stores.
1. What do you enjoy most about your job/studies?; I really like my job, especially since I work as a database internal engineer. My primary responsibility is making our product perform better and tackling tricky issues. Whenever I\'m trying to boost performance, I brainstorm ideas and chat with my colleagues about them. They are super smart and competent and always gives me fresh perspectives and insights that really open my eyes. And another part is Problem-solving. It feels like being a detective – you know, figuring out which clues matter and which don\'t to get to the bottom of things.

1. What's the problem of cache miss rates? How do you address it?; I found that a refactoring PR caused this decrease in performance. After this PR, there\'s a large template function with many branches, but the query with the performance degradation only goes through one of the branches. I suspect that when the instructions are loaded into the code cache, instructions from unused branches are partly loaded, leading to frequent replacements in the code cache line. This might be what\'s causing the performance degradation. However, we tested this only on virtual machines in Alibaba Cloud. Some lower-level perf-events, such as branch-miss and cache-miss, are not supported on VMs, so we couldn\'t directly verify this hypothesis. To address the issue, we separated different branches into distinct template functions and marked them as \"always not inlined.\"
1. What's the process of join operator?; Generally speaking, a join involves a two-stage processing method. The first stage is called \"build,\" where a hash_table is generated based on a smaller table. The second stage, known as \"probe,\" involves going through the hash_table to evaluate matches based on specific predicates.\n\nLocal and Global runtime filters will be generated at build stage to further improve the performance.
1. What's the process of window operator?; For window function without partition by, the data will be sorted globally and send to one node to further continue the serial window process. And for window function with partition by, the data will be shuffled and sorted locally, and then multi-machine and multi-core parallel window processing is carried out.\n\nAnd for window function that is not relied on the ordering, like min/max, we have hash-based partition to further improve the performance.
1. What's the process of aggregation operator?; Generally speaking, for aggregation without group by, there will be a two-stage process, the first stage is called pre-aggregate, where each node perform the aggregation and calculate the intermediate result locally, and then send to one intended node for final aggregation. And for aggregation with group by, there will be a one-stage process, each node will shuffle the scanned data by the group by expression, and then multi-machine and multi-core parallel aggregation processing is carried out.
1. What the process of executing a query?; Generally, it has two stages, plan and execution. Firstly, it will go through rule-based optimizations and cost-based optimizations to generate an optimal physical plan, the plan will contains several segments, connected by exchagne operator. And in practical system, there will be multiply compute nodes, so each fragment will have multiply parallelism to fully use the machine resource, and each parallelism is called fragment instance. When a compute node received a fragment instance, basically, the fragment instance is an execution tree, it will be decomposed into multiply pipelines, and each pipeline will have multiply parallelism to fully use the multi-cores resources.
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Volcano Execution Model and Morsel-driven execution model?; Volcano execution model is simple for programming. And the minimum scheduling unit is thread, so scheduling decision is delegated to kernel. But it is hard to have fine-grained resource control, priority control and parallelism control.\n\nFor morsel-driven execution model, the programming model is more complex, each operator has to handle state change like if it has output or if it need input, and need to provide two interfaces push_chunk and pull_chunk, and blocking opeartions are not allowed, and for some operators like scan and exchange, extra I/O thread pool is required to handle the I/O operations. But it can have more flexible resource control, priority control, and parallelism control, you can set different parallelism for different parts of a single query.
1. I need work authorization sponsorship
1. machines with identical specifications
1. What's the design of the morsel-driven execution model?; Morsel\n* Morsel is a small chunk or portion of data, in our system, its value is 4096.\n\nPipeline and Pipeline Driver\n* Pipeline is a logical concept that represents an execution link, comprising of a sequence of operators that without blocking operations.\n* Each compute node will receive an execution tree, the tree will be decomposed to multiply pipelines, and all the materialized nodes will be split into two pipelines. For example, the join node will split into two pipelines, one contains join_build, and another contains join_probe. And each pipeline can have several parallelism, called pipeline driver, which is the minimum scheduling unit.\n\nUser-Space Scheduler\n* The size of work threads is equal to the size of cpu cores. And core-binding can have better cache locality.\n* And for scheduling algorithm, generally, there are two different options, one is Global Balance, where all workers share a global queue, providing precise wake-ups. The other choice is Work-Stealing, where each worker has a local queue and may experience false wake-ups. In our system, for the resource control feature, we have chosen to implement Global Balance along with a global multi-level feedback queue, the pipeline driver with longer overall execution time may have lower priority and may stay in the higher level.\n* And another thing is task readiness analysis for checking if a task is ready or blocked, there are also two choices, polling model and event-driven model, but the state change of the task in database system is more complex comparing to the threads scheduling in kernel which can only come from limited cases like cpu time slice exhausted, hardware interrupt, system call, mutex and explicit yielding, the state change in database system may come from asynchronous operations, task dependency readiness, and more complex condition that may contains several variables and compoments. So polling model is suitable for database system, and simplify the process to a great extend. And in our system, there will be a seperate thread to do the task readiness analysis.
1. Why do you introduce morsel-driven execution model?; Because comparing to the volcano execution model, morsel-driven execution model has better fexibility on resource control, priority control and parallelism control. And we also expect it can have better scheduling efficiency.
1. Explain the details of the parallel merge operator; The implementation is based on the MergePath algorithm, the most impressive part of this algorithm is that each core can independently compute the data segment required by current core. Multiple inputs are organized into a Merge tree. The entire merge process uses the stream model and requires multiple traversals of the merge tree. Each traversal uses a bottom-up approach, with all cores sequentially processing each node, for example, all cores are working on a merge node\'s process and then goes to the next merge node. And additionally, I dopted late materialization to further improve the performance.

1. How does starrocks process subquery?; Subqueries are always placed within expressions. After constant removal and predicate simplification are performed, a subquery can be replaced with an apply operator and attached to the logical tree. Finally, different types of joins can be utilized to transform the apply operator.
1. How many subquery transformation rules in Starrocks?
1. Could describe the subquery classifications?
1. What's optimization can lead to 10 times performance boost of the ranking window function?; When using a ranking window function with a predicate or a limit clause, we have the option to include an additional partition-topn node to filter the data. This can lead to significant improvements, particularly when it comes to filtering out large amounts of data.
1. Why do you refactor the subquery transformation process?; * In the previous process, the subquery would be transformed to ApplyOperator first, missing the opportunity to apply optimizations such as constant removal or predicate simplification\n* After this refactor, the subquery used as an expression will be temporarily held back until the expression optimizations are performed, allowing it to fully benefit from these optimizations

What's the function of the OS pipeline?; The pipeline supports the selection of various customized configurations, such as different applications, network settings, partition setups, and account configurations.\n\nCentOS offers an image build tool called Anaconda, which provides a flexible configuration known as kickstart for customized settings. This includes network configuration, disk setup, account settings, as well as scripts for more complex configurations.\n\nDifferent production methods, including PXE(Preboot Execution Environment), Master Disk Duplication, Root Filesystem Flashing
1. How is operator overloading achieved?; Each function description can be mapped to a group of implementations, each of which has a priority. The implementation with a higher priority matches first.
1. What's the most difficult thing you've encountered when implementing it?; The most challenging aspect, in my opinion, is defining an unambiguous grammar for a specific language. I\'ve gained insights from many mature languages, such as Java.
1. What components does the compiler framework have?; 1. A lexical analyzer, parses the original content into a sequence of tokens.\n2. A Grammar Parser, supports several types of grammar analysis algorithm, like, LL1(Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation), LALR(Look-Ahead, Left-to-right, Rightmost Derivation), LR1(Left-to-Right, Rightmost derivation)
1. Why not just use the message middleware?; Offers more flexibility in routing messages than message middleware platforms like Kafka or RocketMQ, allowing for the provision of more complex rules based on the structural characteristics of the device messages.
1. What's the function of message route?; The function of a message route is to deliver specific messages that are required by a single service from quantities of original device messages.
1. How can the web browser serve as the user-side agent without any configuration?; The web browser will set the original host as the \'Host\' field in the HTTP header. By leveraging this property, the server can create a unique HTTP address for a specific service of a particular user. The first segment of the address is a UUID, which can be resolved to its corresponding tunnel information. This helps the server direct the traffic to the correct edge device.
1. How does the tunnel service work?; It begins with the user opening the terminal on our console or navigating to another web page with a unique address. Then, the server sends a \'NewSession\' packet to the corresponding device. If the specific port of the local device is available, the session is established. Any actions from the user will be routed to the device, and any messages from the device\'s service will be routed to the user.
